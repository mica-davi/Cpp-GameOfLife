<h2>Game of Life</h2>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Davi, and this is my implementation of the game of life in C++. This project was made following along the video tutorial made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daFYGrXq0aw&ab_channel=ProgrammingWithNick">Programming with Nick</a>.</p>

<h3>Dependencies:</h3>
<p>The only aditional dependency you will need to run this project is the raylib for cpp. See how to download and install it <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Running</h3>
<p>After configuring raylib in your project, you can just compile it and run the program.</p>
